  <h2>Programs</h2>

  <h3>Objective</h3>
  
  <p>
    The idea behind the program section is for users to create programs that find a balance between what
    nature reuqires and what society demands.  They should also be created with trying to find a balance
    between desired level of health and sustainability.  Too strict of a program will be 
    difficult for most.  Too loose, won't be healthy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Programs created here are available for all users to join.  Each one has its discussion feed
    where you can share your ideas on the program with others.  You can rate any program that you 
    join.

  <h3>Nature</h3>
  
  <p>
    Nature operates by immutable, predefined rules.  They are on one hand very complex, but on another
    very simple.  They are well understood and have been for quite some time.  The simple side
    is that we are designed by nature to eat raw fruits, vegetables, nuts and seed, keeping fat to
    a minimum, and avoiding processed foods, especially SOS(salt, oils and sugar).  
    I know, it
    is not what you want to here, but nature does not care.  As mentioned above, it will be difficult
    for most.  For some, it may be difficult to believe, but again, nature's rules are immutable and
    will not shape to our beliefs.
  </p>

  <h3>Society</h3>
  
  <p>
    We have been taught various customs that are centered around food.  Weddings, funerals, birthdays,
    rites of passage, etc. all are celebrated with a feast.  Growing up, most of us have eaten
    predominately cooked foods.  We have been rewarded with foods, food has been our consolation
    in hard times, we have these amoung other emotional attachments. I hope this sheds some light
    on the conflict between nature and society.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our social gatherings although customarily centered around food, but what's really important is
    the sharing of time with friends and family.  With this in mind, it is our hope that we can
    come up with new ways to celebrate that promote health, you can enjoy what is important, the 
    people we are celebrating with and make the perspective shift that good healthy food will not take
    away anything from this.

  <h3>Programs</h3>

  <p>
    Programs created here are available for all users to join.  Each one has its discussion feed
    where you can share your ideas on the program with others.  You can rate any program that you 
    join.
  </p>
  <h4>Program levels</h4>
  <p>
    The "ideal" is as mentioned, raw fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds.  Setting a level for a program
    is an indication of how close to this "ideal" the program is.  This should give users wishing to
    join an idea of the difficulty in sustaining the program.  Levels range from 0-100, where 100
    is the ideal, and 0, what's the point.
  </p>

  <h4>Program Phases</h4>
  You can optionally create the program in phases, for example if you want to work towards and 80%
  program, but want to gradually get there you can start with say 60% and work your way to where the
  final phase would be the 80%
